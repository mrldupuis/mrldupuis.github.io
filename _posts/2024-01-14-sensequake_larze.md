VERY excited to start doing some in-office testing with these instruments which [Geosyntec](https://geosyntec.com/) has purchased from the nice folks at [Sensequake](https://www.sensequake.com/) in Montreal, Canada.

With their high precision and low levels of self-noise, these will be excellent instruments for ambient vibration testing of dams.
