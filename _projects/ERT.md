This software addresses a common challenge in engineering: handling large, complex time-history datasets from various sources (e.g., earthquake records, structural responses). It’s designed to streamline data extraction, processing, and visualization in a user-friendly way, filling the gaps left by existing commercial tools.

## Key Features

1. **Intuitive GUI**:  
   - Simple interface flattens the learning curve for new users.
   - Workspace saving and loading for consistent project continuity.
   - Supports sharing of processing workflows, making it easy to replicate results.

2. **Data Extraction & Metadata Merging**:
   - Reads various file types, pulling out essential data like time-history signals and metadata.
   - Users can add extra metadata (e.g., project, location, or test details) via CSV import to enrich datasets.

3. **Collection Pipeline Workflow**:
   - Includes built-in post-processing functions for time-history data, like FFT (Fast Fourier Transform), frequency filtering, and table filtering.
   - Intensity metrics, grouping, and statistical functions (median, geometric mean) to quickly analyze data trends.

4. **Rapid Figure Creation**:
   - Generate customized, publication-ready figures directly from processed data.
   - Control over figure details like axis scaling, labeling, and gridlines.
   - Zoom, pan, and export options for focused data visualization.
