# Structural Design Package (SDP) for Concrete Dam Components

- [Overview Video Here](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/michael-dupuis-99539662_this-structural-design-software-tool-started-activity-7237577486723641344--6Tb?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)

The Structural Design Package (SDP) is a free educational tool designed to simplify the design and analysis of concrete dam structures. Itâ€™s geared towards students and professionals who want to explore structural calculations for components like slabs, beams, and walls, commonly needed in dam projects.

## Why SDP?

Creating detailed design reports for dam structures is often tedious and repetitive. Many commercial tools offer limited flexibility, can be pricey, and lack easy options for prototyping. SDP addresses these challenges by offering two ways to interact with the tool:
- **GUI (Graphical User Interface)**: Accessible to users without programming experience.
- **API (Application Programming Interface)**: Allows advanced users to script custom workflows in Python.

    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/SDP/sdp_gui.PNG" title="SDP Graphical user Interface" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>

        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/SDP/sdp_api.PNG" title="SDP Application Programming Interface" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

## How It Works

SDP uses Python (with wxPython for GUI) and LaTeX to automate the design package creation, which includes:
- **Project management**: Organizes structural elements within a single report.
- **Component library**: Supports various concrete elements (e.g., beams, slabs).
- **Automated calculations**: Runs capacity checks and code compliance evaluations based on design inputs.

The application compiles design information into a ready-to-review PDF report, which can be generated with a few clicks.

        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/SDP/beam_component_diagram.PNG" title="Beam component diagram" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

## Key Features

- **Free and Educational**: Made for educational purposes, SDP is free to download and use.
- **Flexible Design Workflow**: Build projects through GUI or custom Python scripts.
- **Accurate Reporting**: PDF reports with visual summaries and calculation details.

## Future Plans

Future versions aim to add:
- More structural components (e.g., columns)
- New materials like steel and timber
- Expanded design standards (e.g., ACI318-19, CSA A23.3)

SDP is available for educational use, so feel free to try it out and provide feedback to help shape future releases!
