I also linearly detrended the velocity data and applied a Tukey window in the time domain.</p> <p>The RS 3D time series data exhibits significant low-frequency drift, both at the free field location and at the dam crest. For the dam crest, which was expected to exhibit vibrations due to release of water through the low-level outlet, the amplitudes of vibrations are relatively large, particularly in the instream and vertical directions. Furthermore, and more concerning, transient wave trains at the free field location appear to have different arrival times in each of the three directions, which indicates possible issues with the time synchronization between the channels of the single instrument.</p> <div class="l-page"> <iframe src="/assets/html/glenmoredam_20230825/TS-Free%20Field.html" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" height="500px" width="100%" style="border: 1px dashed grey;"></iframe> </div> <div class="caption"> Example segment of velocity time series at the free field location. </div> <div class="l-page"> <iframe src="/assets/html/glenmoredam_20230825/TS-Dam%20Crest.html" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" height="500px" width="100%" style="border: 1px dashed grey;"></iframe> </div> <div class="caption"> Example segment of velocity time series at the dam crest. </div> <p>MEM-based power spectral density estimates were also examined for recordings at both the free field location and the dam crest.

Attributing these resonances to specific component behavior is complicated by the multiple components which contribute to the response at this location, including the dam body, piers, and elevated arch bridge superstructure.</p> <div class="l-page"> <iframe src="/assets/html/glenmoredam_20230825/MEM-Free%20Field.html" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" height="500px" width="100%" style="border: 1px dashed grey;"></iframe> </div> <div class="caption"> Power spectral density estimates computed via the maximum entropy method at the free field location. </div> <div class="l-page"> <iframe src="/assets/html/glenmoredam_20230825/MEM-Dam%20Crest.html" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" height="500px" width="100%" style="border: 1px dashed grey;"></iframe> </div> <div class="caption"> Power spectral density estimates computed via the maximum entropy method at the dam crest. </div> <p>So far, based on my testing with the shake, its suitability for ambient vibration testing appears to be limited by its poor time control/synchronization, reliance on external power supply and dedicated laptop, and relatively low sampling rate of only 100 Hz (Nyquist frequency of only 50 Hz). I can’t imagine trying to sync up multiple devices for sampling at multiple locations. However, it may still be a good option for certain applications due to its relatively low cost.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="signal-processing"/><category term="vibrations"/><category term="RS3D"/><category term="dams"/><category term="ERT"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Analyzed the Raspberry Shake data from Glenmore Dam]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Glenmore Dam Testing</title><link href="https://mrldupuis.github.io/blog/2023/glenmore_dam_testing/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Glenmore Dam Testing"/><published>2023-07-12T21:01:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-07-12T21:01:00+00:00</updated><id>https://mrldupuis.github.io/blog/2023/glenmore_dam_testing</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://mrldupuis.github.io/blog/2023/glenmore_dam_testing/"><![CDATA[<p>I went out at the crack of dawn during a long summer day hoping to avoid looking suspicious while there were too many people around.</p> <p>I deployed the velocitmeter for approximately twenty minutes of data acquisition at two locations: (i) a public pathway above dam crest and (ii) at a free field approximately 100 m downstream of the dam. Data was collected on all three instrument channels for a duration of 20 minutes at each location during ambient operating conditions with approximately 1.5 cms of release through the low-level outlet (there is no power generation at Glenmore Dam). It was observed that the reservoir was at full pool and no irregular activities or events were noted which would have perturbed the ambient data collected at either location.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/PXL_20230825_140821473.jpg" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/PXL_20230825_140821473.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> View from downstream of the gated overflow spillway, piers, and supported walkway of the Glenmore Dam. </div> <p>At each location, data collection with the RS velocimeter followed the following procedure:</p> <ol> <li>The portable power supply was turned on and connected to the field laptop which was also powered on.</li> <li>The RS-3D was connected to the laptop via ethernet cable.</li> <li>The RS-3D GPS antenna was connected to the RS-3D.</li> <li>The RS-3D was leveled using three leveling pins and a built-in bubble level and recording channels were oriented to be orthogonal to the axis of the dam (crossvalley; instream; and vertical)</li> <li>All wires were cleared from the perimeter of the device and a perimeter was delineated around the device.</li> <li>The RS-3D was plugged into the portable power supply.</li> <li>Data was collected during ambient operating conditions on all three recording channels.</li> </ol> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/PXL_20230825_134425813.jpg" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/PXL_20230825_134425813.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/PXL_20230825_140818187.jpg" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/PXL_20230825_140818187.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Experimental setup of the Raspberry Shake 3D, portable power supply, laptop, and GPS antenna at Glenmore Dam: above the dam crest (left) and downstream free field (right). </div> <p>I hope to analyze this data to see if I can pick up any machinery harmonics (although there is no power generation at Glenmore Dam) or structural resonances of the gravity monolith or piers.</p> <p>Mostly I’m glab nobody called the police on me…</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="instrumentation"/><category term="vibrations"/><category term="RS3D"/><category term="dams"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recorded vibration data from a large dam with the Raspberry Shake]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Raspberry Shake Field Kit</title><link href="https://mrldupuis.github.io/blog/2023/raspberry_shake_kit/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Raspberry Shake Field Kit"/><published>2023-05-15T21:01:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-05-15T21:01:00+00:00</updated><id>https://mrldupuis.github.io/blog/2023/raspberry_shake_kit</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://mrldupuis.github.io/blog/2023/raspberry_shake_kit/"><![CDATA[<p>I’ve assembled a mobile testing kit using a <a href="https://shop.raspberryshake.org/product/turnkey-iot-home-earth-monitor-rs-3d/">Raspberry Shake 3D</a> (RS 3D) velocimeter that I plan to use in the field.
