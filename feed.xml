For the dam crest, which was expected to exhibit vibrations due to release of water through the low-level outlet, the amplitudes of vibrations are relatively large, particularly in the instream and vertical directions. Furthermore, and more concerning, transient wave trains at the free field location appear to have different arrival times in each of the three directions, which indicates possible issues with the time synchronization between the channels of the single instrument.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/html/glenmoredam_20230825/TS-Free%20Field.html" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/html/glenmoredam_20230825/TS-Free%20Field.html" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/html/glenmoredam_20230825/TS-Dam%20Crest.html" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/html/glenmoredam_20230825/TS-Dam%20Crest.html" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Example segment of velocity time series recorded by the Raspberry Shake instrument at the free field location (left) and the dam crest (right). </div> <p>MEM-based power spectral density estimates were also examined for recordings at both the free field location and the dam crest.
