Michael Dupuis is a [Senior Engineer based in California](https://geosyntec.com/people/michael-dupuis) with more than 10 years of experience focused on the seismic analysis and structural design of large concrete dams and buildings. His consulting and research experience has included projects in Canada, Japan, Taiwan, New Zealand, and the United States.

His areas of expertise include strong ground-motion selection and processing, ground-motion simulation, data science and visualization, seismic upgrades to existing structures, structural analysis of dam and powerhouse structures, and seismic analysis and design of concrete and steel structures. He has professional experience as a structural consultant working on large concrete gravity dams in British Columbia where he performed structural analyses and earthquake ground-motion processing for large-scale seismic upgrade projects. Michael has also conducted the seismic and structural analysis and design of unique mixed-use structures such as skytrain stations, libraries, sport centers, and commercial and residential high-rise towers and served as the designer for projects across western Canada.

Michael’s interest in various aspects of earthquake engineering have led him to build a multifaceted practice at the intersection of structural engineering and seismology and leverage his interdisciplinary strengths. Early in his career, Michael’s post-graduate research at the University of British Columbia provided the basis for a new Gravity-Induced Lateral Demand seismic irregularity code clause in the National Building Code of Canada which safeguards the public from collapse of buildings with sloped columns. Michael subsequently provided specialized earthquake engineering services as a structural consultant for building developers and dam owners in British Columbia Canada where he became skilled at finite-element analysis of structures using SAP2000, ETABS, SAFE, and LS-DYNA. In his capacity as an engineer and a researcher, his drive to build systematic engineering solutions has led him to develop multiple software programs for data processing, post-processing of structural analysis results, and ground-motion record processing.

<!-- Michael is currently completing a Ph.D. program focused on improving ground-motion prediction for subduction earthquakes using physics-based simulations at the University of Canterbury in New Zealand. The outcomes of his research will be incorporated in the National Seismic Hazard Model of New Zealand and will have global applicability for seismic analysis of dams for which long-duration subduction megathrust earthquake ground-motion records are uniquely hazardous and observed records are only available from two such earthquakes. -->
