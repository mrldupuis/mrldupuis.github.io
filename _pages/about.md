I am an [Engineer based in California](https://geosyntec.com/people/michael-dupuis).

I primarily work on the seismic analysis and structural design of large concrete dams and buildings, but I also really enjoy software development and data analysis.

I've been fortunate to work on projects across Canada, Japan, Taiwan, New Zealand, and the United States.
