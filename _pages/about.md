I'm an Analyst, [Engineer](https://geosyntec.com/people/michael-dupuis) and [Ph.D. Candidate](https://sites.google.com/site/brendonabradley/people?authuser=0).

I develop custom in-house software packages and data pipelines to solve complex analytical problems.

My work has focused on physics-based earthquake ground-motion simulation, design of reinforced concrete and steel structures, developing hazard compatible earthquake ground-motion time series, operational modal analysis of dams, and seismic structural analysis of large concrete dams and buildings.

I've worked in Canada, Japan, New Zealand, and the United States.
