I'm an [Engineer](https://geosyntec.com/people/michael-dupuis) and [Ph.D. Candidate](https://sites.google.com/site/brendonabradley/people?authuser=0).

I primarily work on earthquake ground motion simulation, quantitative risk analysis, and seismic analysis of large concrete dams and buildings. I also really enjoy software development and data analysis.

I've been fortunate to work on projects across Canada, Japan, Taiwan, New Zealand, and the United States.
